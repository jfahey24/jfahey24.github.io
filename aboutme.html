    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Jake Fahey. I am currently attending the University of Rhode Island and I am majoring in film studies along with minoring in business. Some of my hobbies include writing, either on my own or for the school paper, praticing guitar, photography, and watching films and logging them online. I'm mainly taking this computer programing class as a general elective but I've always been interested in seeing how programs and websites are created. Over the course of my time in this class I will be regularly updating this website as I learn.</p>
